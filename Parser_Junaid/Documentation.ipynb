    "## **Language Specification for EngC**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "EngC is a programming language designed with English-like syntax to make programming more intuitive for beginners, but it is still heavily inspired by C and C++. The language uses natural language constructs for operations and control flow, making code more readable and closer to plain English. Our project aims to convert EngC (a high level language) into Assembly code and then we will be attempting to convert that Assembly code to C++ code. To do this, we will be implementing all 6 phases of compiler construction from the lexical analysis to the code generation. below is phase by phase breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "## Language Structure and Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "EngC's lexical elements are defined by the following token types:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Elements | Examples |\n",
    "|----------|----------|----------|\n",
    "| **Keywords** | Basic control structures | `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `main` |\n",
    "| **Types** | Data types supported | `integer`, `float`, `bool` |\n",
    "| **Literals** | Constant values | Numbers (`10`, `3.14`), Boolean (`true`, `false`) |\n",

    "| **Identifiers** | Variable and function names | Valid names start with letters or underscore |\n",
    "| **Punctuation** | Structure elements | `semicolon`, `comma`, `{`, `}`, `(`, `)` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators\n",
    "EngC uses English words for operators instead of symbols:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arithmetic Operators**:\n",
    "   - `add` (addition)\n",
    "   - `subtract` (subtraction)\n",
    "   - `multiply` (multiplication)\n",
    "   - `divide` (division)\n",
    "   - `remainder` (modulo)\n",
    "   - `power` (exponentiation)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assignment Operators**:\n",
    "   - `equals to` (basic assignment)\n",
    "   - `add equal to` (+=)\n",
    "   - `subtract equal to` (-=)\n",

    "   - `and` (logical AND)\n",
    "   - `or` (logical OR)\n",
    "   - `not` (logical NOT)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs in EngC start with a main function declaration and contain statements within code blocks denoted by braces. Statements are terminated with a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Program Structure\n",
    "```\n",
    "integer main () {\n",
    "    // Statements go here\n",
    "    integer a equals to 10 semicolon\n",
    "    // More statements\n",

    "## Lexical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The lexical analysis phase in our EngC compiler is a multi-stage process that transforms raw source code into a stream of tokens. This process is implemented across several Python modules, each responsible for a specific transformation step. Below, we detail each stage, referencing the actual code and data flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Token Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Token types and their regular expressions are defined in `language.txt`. This file is parsed by the scanner to build a mapping from token names to regex patterns. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "KEYWORD       : if|else|for|while|main|do\n",
    "TYPE          : integer|float|string|bool\n",
    "IDENTIFIER    : [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*\n",
    "FLOAT         : \\d+\\.\\d+\n",
    "NUMBER        : \\d+\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This mapping is loaded and processed by `token_definition.py` and used throughout the scanner pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Regex Tokenization and Infix-to-Postfix Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are first tokenized (`tokenize_regex.py`) to break them into atomic symbols and operators. Since Thompson’s construction requires postfix (Reverse Polish) notation, we convert infix regexes to postfix using the Shunting Yard algorithm in `postfix_conversion.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Infix: `(a|b)*abb`\n",
    "- Postfix: `ab|*a.b.b.`\n",
    "\n",
    "This conversion is crucial for stack-based NFA construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Thompson’s Construction: Regex to NFA\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of our scanner is the conversion of postfix regexes to NFAs, implemented in `postfix_to_nfa.py`. Using Thompson’s construction, we:\n",
    "- Push NFA fragments onto a stack for each symbol/operator.\n",
    "- Pop and combine fragments for concatenation (`.`), alternation (`|`), and closure (`*`).\n",
    "- Build a complete NFA for each token type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Snippet:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In postfix_to_nfa.py\n",
    "def postfix_to_nfa(postfix):\n",
    "    stack = []\n",
    "    for char in postfix:\n",
    "        if char == '*':\n",
    "            nfa = stack.pop()\n",
    "            stack.append(apply_kleene_star(nfa))\n",
    "        elif char == '|':\n",
    "            nfa2 = stack.pop()\n",
    "            nfa1 = stack.pop()\n",
    "            stack.append(apply_union(nfa1, nfa2))\n",
    "        elif char == '.':\n",
    "            nfa2 = stack.pop()\n",
    "            nfa1 = stack.pop()\n",
    "            stack.append(apply_concatenation(nfa1, nfa2))\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            stack.append(create_basic_nfa(char))\n",
    "    return stack.pop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization:**  \n",
    "We use `plot_nfa.py` to generate diagrams of the constructed NFAs for each token, aiding debugging and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. NFA to DFA: Subset Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "NFAs are converted to DFAs using the subset construction algorithm in `nfa_to_dfa.py`. This process:\n",
    "- Computes ε-closures for all NFA states.\n",
    "- Builds DFA states as sets of NFA states.\n",
    "- Ensures deterministic transitions for every input symbol.\n",

    "- **Initial NFA:** 372 states, 14,205 edges (for all tokens combined)\n",
    "- **Converted DFA:** 151 states, 6,320 edges\n",
    "\n",
    "This dramatic reduction is achieved through determinization and later minimization.\n",

    "### 5. DFA Minimization and Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The DFA is further optimized in `optimize_dfa.py`:\n",
    "- **Dead State Removal:** Unreachable states are pruned.\n",
    "- **Hopcroft’s Algorithm:** Merges equivalent states, minimizing the DFA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:**  \n",
    "- **Final DFA:** 151 states, 6,320 edges (down from 372/14,205 in the un-optimized DFA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimized DFA is exported as a transition table (`dfa_table.py`) and visualized in `Scanner-dfa.xlsx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. DFA Table and Scanning\n",
    "\n",
    "The DFA transition table is used by `scanner.py` to efficiently scan input text:\n",
    "- The scanner reads characters, follows DFA transitions, and records the last accepting state.\n",
    "- On failure, it emits the longest-matching token (maximal munch).\n",
    "- Whitespace and comments are skipped.\n",
    "- Errors are reported for unrecognized sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Snippet:**\n",
    "```python\n",

    "#### 1. Grammar Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "We augment the grammar by adding a new start production `S' → program` to recognize complete programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. FIRST Sets Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST sets are calculated for all grammar symbols to determine which terminals can appear at the beginning of strings derived from each symbol:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "FIRST(TYPE) = {TYPE}\n",
    "FIRST(IDENTIFIER) = {IDENTIFIER}\n",
    "FIRST(expression) = {IDENTIFIER, NUMBER, FLOAT, BOOL, LPAREN}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. LR(1) Items and Canonical Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "An LR(1) item is a production with a dot at some position and a lookahead terminal. For example:\n",
    "- `[function → TYPE • IDENTIFIER LPAREN parameters RPAREN block, $]`\n",
    "- `[expression → simple_expression • RELATIONAL_OP simple_expression, SEMICOLON]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical collection organizes these items into states through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Closure Operation**: Expands item sets by adding related items\n",
    "2. **GOTO Operation**: Determines transitions between states on symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation generates a collection of 87 distinct states from the EngC grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. ACTION and GOTO Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "The LR(1) parser uses two tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ACTION Table**: Determines parser actions (shift, reduce, accept, error)\n",
    "- **Shift**: Move to next state while consuming a token\n",
    "- **Reduce**: Apply a grammar rule by replacing RHS with LHS\n",
    "- **Accept**: Successfully recognize the input\n",
    "- **Error**: Reject invalid input\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOTO Table**: Determines which state to transition to after a reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Parsing Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Our stack-based parsing algorithm:\n",
    "1. Initializes with state 0\n",
    "2. Repeatedly consults the ACTION table based on current state and input token\n",
    "3. Performs shifts, reductions, or accepts accordingly\n",
    "4. Builds a parse tree representing the program's structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parse Tree Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "During parsing, our implementation constructs a concrete parse tree where:\n",
    "- Interior nodes represent non-terminals\n",
    "- Leaf nodes represent terminals with their lexeme values\n",
    "- The tree structure reflects the application of grammar rules\n",

    "- **Syntax errors**: Invalid token sequences\n",
    "- **Recovery mechanisms**: Synchronization at statement boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Parsing Process\n",
    "\n",
    "For the EngC code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "integer x equals to 5 semicolon\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser follows these steps:\n",
    "1. Shift TYPE (integer)\n",
    "2. Shift IDENTIFIER (x)\n",
    "3. Shift ASSIGN_OP (equals to)\n",
    "4. Shift NUMBER (5)\n",
    "5. Shift SEMICOLON (semicolon)\n",
    "6. Reduce by rule: factor → NUMBER\n",
    "7. Reduce by rule: term → factor\n",
    "8. Reduce by rule: simple_expression → term\n",
    "9. Reduce by rule: expression → simple_expression\n",
    "10. Reduce by rule: declaration → TYPE IDENTIFIER ASSIGN_OP expression SEMICOLON\n",
    "11. Reduce by rule: statement → declaration\n",
    "12. ...and so on until the entire program is recognized\n",

    "After generating the intermediate representation, our compiler applies a suite of optimization techniques to improve code efficiency before target code generation. This phase transforms the Three-Address Code (TAC) into an equivalent but more efficient representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Our optimizer implements the following techniques that operate on the TAC representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constant Folding and Propagation**\n",
    "   - Evaluates constant expressions at compile time (e.g., `5 + 3` → `8`)\n",
    "   - Propagates known constant values through variable references\n",
    "   - Reduces runtime computation by performing calculations during compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Copy Propagation**\n",
    "   - Replaces variables with their assigned values where possible\n",
    "   - Eliminates unnecessary assignments and variable copies\n",
    "   - Example: Converts `x = y; z = x;` to `x = y; z = y;`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)**\n",
    "   - Identifies repeated expressions and computes them only once\n",
    "   - Stores results in temporary variables for reuse\n",
    "   - Reduces redundant calculations in the program\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dead Code Elimination**\n",
    "   - Removes assignments to variables that are never used\n",
    "   - Eliminates unreachable code blocks after conditional jumps\n",
    "   - Removes no-op instructions that have no effect\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Algebraic Simplifications**\n",
    "   - Applies algebraic identities to simplify expressions\n",
    "   - Examples: `x * 1 → x`, `x + 0 → x`, `x - x → 0`, `x * 0 → 0`\n",
    "   - Replaces complex operations with simpler, equivalent operations\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Loop Optimizations**\n",
    "   - Loop invariant code motion: Moves calculations outside loops when possible\n",
    "   - Strength reduction: Replaces expensive operations with cheaper equivalents\n",
    "   - Example: Converts multiplication to addition in iterative calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Peephole Optimization**\n",
    "   - Examines small windows of code to find local improvements\n",
    "   - Replaces sequences of instructions with more efficient equivalents\n",
    "   - Example: Merges consecutive operations on the same variables\n",

    "### Optimization Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our optimizer processes the TAC in multiple passes, with each pass applying one or more optimization techniques. This multi-pass approach ensures that optimization opportunities exposed by one technique can be captured by subsequent passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization process is controlled by the `optimize_tac` function, which orchestrates the application of various optimization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, the TAC is analyzed to build a control flow graph\n",
    "2. Next, data flow analysis identifies variable definitions and uses\n",
    "3. Then, optimization passes are applied in sequence\n",
    "4. Finally, the optimized TAC is validated for correctness\n",
